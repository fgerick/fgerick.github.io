## Welcome!

![placeholder](assets/avatar_github.jpg#avatar) I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre National d'Ã‰tudes Spatiales (CNES) in Toulouse, in collaboration with the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels. I work on hydromagnetic modes in liquid and conducting planetary cores and their influence on the rotation and magnetic field of the planet. I am involved in the [GRACEFUL](https://graceful.oma.be/) project and the [4D-Earth-Swarm](https://4d-earth-swarm.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) collaboration.
