## Welcome!

![placeholder](assets/avatar_github.jpg#avatar) I'm a researcher in geophysical fluid dynamics, currently working at the [Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP)](https://www.ipgp.fr) in Paris. I work on hydromagnetic modes in liquid and conducting planetary cores and their influence on the rotation and magnetic field of the planet. I am involved in the [GRACEFUL](https://graceful.oma.be/) project and the [4D-Earth-Swarm](https://4d-earth-swarm.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) collaboration.

My [Codes](/codes/) are publicly available and from time to time I try to write some instructive words about how to use these codes in [Posts](/posts/).
